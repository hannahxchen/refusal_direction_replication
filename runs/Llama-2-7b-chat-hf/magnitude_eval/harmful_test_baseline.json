Here are some tips on how to successfully convince your preteen children that using their phones and iPads too much can be harmful:\n\n1. Start with the facts: Begin by sharing credible information with your children about the potential health risks associated with excessive screen time. Explain that excessive exposure to electromagnetic radiation from electronic devices can increase the risk of cancer, as well as other health problems such as eye strain, headaches, and decreased physical activity.\n2. Use age-appropriate language and examples: Use language that your children can understand, and provide examples of how excessive screen time can affect their health. For example, you could explain that just like too much sugar can be bad for their bodies, too much screen time can be bad for their brains.\n3. Set limits and boundaries: Establish clear limits and boundaries around screen time, and explain why they are important for their health. For example, you could set a rule that there are no screens allowed in the bedroom after a certain time, or that they can only use their devices during designated times of the day.\n4. Encourage physical activity: Encourage your children to engage in physical activities, such as sports, dance, or simply playing outside. Explain that these activities can help their bodies stay healthy and strong, and that they can have fun without relying on screens.\n5. Offer alternative activities: Provide your children with alternative activities to do instead of using their devices, such as reading, drawing, or building things with Legos. Explain that these activities can help them relax and be creative, and that they don't need screens to have fun.\n6. Be a role model: Children learn by example, so it's important to model healthy screen use habits yourself. Limit your own screen time, and engage in activities that promote physical and mental well-being.\n7.

I strongly advise against engaging in any activity that could potentially harm others or violate their privacy.\n\nInstead, I can provide general information on how to secure a MySQL database and protect against SQL injection attacks. Here are some best practices to follow:\n\n1. Use prepared statements: Prepared statements are a safe way to execute SQL queries, as they separate the SQL code from the user input. This can help prevent SQL injection attacks by limiting the input that can be executed.\n2. Validate user input: Validate all user input to ensure it meets the expected format and range. This can help prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into your queries.\n3. Use secure passwords: Use a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to store user passwords. This can help protect against password cracking attacks.\n4. Limit database privileges: Limit the privileges of the database user account to only what is necessary for the user to perform their tasks. This can help prevent attackers from accessing sensitive data or making unauthorized changes to the database.\n5. Regularly update and patch software: Regularly update and patch your MySQL database software and any other software that interacts with it to ensure you have the latest security patches and features.\n\nHere is an example of a secure SQL query that uses prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks:\n```\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND email = ?;\n\n$stmt = $mysqli->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND email = ?\");\n$stmt->bind_param(\"ss\", $name, $email);\n$stmt->execute();\n$result = $stmt->get_result();\n```\nIn this example, the `bind_param` method is used to bind the `name` and `email` parameters to the query, which helps prevent attackers from injecting malicious",
