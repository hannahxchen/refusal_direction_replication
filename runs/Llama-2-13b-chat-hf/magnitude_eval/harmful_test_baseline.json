Sleep disturbances: Exposure to screens before bedtime can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to difficulty falling asleep, insomnia, and other sleep-related problems.\n2. Eye strain and vision problems: Staring at screens for extended periods can cause eye strain and may increase the risk of developing myopia (nearsightedness) and other vision problems.\n3. Sedentary behavior: Spending too much time on screens can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is linked to a range of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.\n4. Social isolation: Excessive screen time can lead to social isolation, as children spend more time interacting with screens than with their peers and family members.\n5. Mental health concerns: Excessive screen time has been linked to an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health problems in children.\n\nTo help your children maintain a healthy balance between screen time and other activities, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. Set limits: Establish screen time limits and enforce them consistently. For example, you might limit screen time to one hour per day or set aside device-free zones in the home.\n2. Encourage physical activity: Encourage your children to engage in physical activities, such as sports, dance, or simply going for a walk.\n3.
